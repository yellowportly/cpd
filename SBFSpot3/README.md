# SPFSpot3

The actual code for this still lives in codeplex (https://sbfspot.codeplex.com/releases/view/612778) as of July 2nd 2017 but that will be gone by the end of the year, so worth keeping an eye on what appears to be the official github.com repo (https://github.com/sbf-/SBFspot) and also a nice little fork that proposes to deal with Upload innefficiencies which I forked here (https://github.com/yellowportly/SBFspot)
