# cpd
Small projects using Pis and ESP8266s with MQTT

Look in the indidivdual directories for code examples

- SBFSpot3
  - No code in here just a README.md with useful pointers to the SBFSpot3 code


- SMADataPump
  - take data generated by SBFSpot and pop the last entry on an MQTT topic

- cpd-web
  - Early draft of a web page to show stats on the CHIP which have been stored in the CHIP's database. Most of these will have been added by the DHT11 process via teh java code below, but some of them may have come from the SolarPi

- dash-button
  - First draft of the door bell program

- drupal8
  - bits and pieces used for teh NP/iot drupal theme

- electricity_monitor
  - currently (geddit!) used to capture the flow on my consumer supply. Very much in progress

- java/IOTStuff
  - Used to monitor the MQTT queue that the DHT11 is sending on and then to pop that data into the SQLite3 DB used by the cpd-web stuff

- lua
  - The LUA code used on the ESPs
